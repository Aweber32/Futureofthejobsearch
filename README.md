# Future of the Job Search — UI Scaffold

This repository contains a Next.js + Bootstrap UI scaffold for the Job Seeker / Job Poster flow.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Project structure highlights:
- `pages/` — page routes and placeholders
- `components/` — shared UI components
- `public/` — static assets (logo)

Next steps you may ask me to do:
- Wire auth and DB
- Implement real forms and validation
- Add tests and CI
